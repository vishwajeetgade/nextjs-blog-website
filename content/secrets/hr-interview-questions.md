## Random - HR Interview Questions

#### 1. Tell me about yourself
Hello, my full name is Vishwajeet Gade, and I currently reside in Mumbai. I completed my BE graduation in computer science in 2021 from Sinhgad Institute of Technology, Lonavala. I have 2.5 years of experience in the IT industry as a Full Stack Developer. Most of my experience has been as a Front-End developer using technologies like React.js, Redux, Node.js, and a template engine called EJS. I have worked on various Fintech and LMS applications over the past 2 years. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in backend development using technologies such as MongoDB and Express.js. I have also worked with Angular and React Native.

##### 2. Why did you quit your previous job ?
I didn't like the work culture and colleagues; it felt like some sort of favoritism as they were all from the same college and place too. Additionally, despite giving an ETA, the manager wanted us to work extra hours to complete the task ahead of time for some reason. Since it was a small organization, there weren't many projects to switch to, so the management wasn't helpful either. I tried working there, but due to health issues, I decided to quit that job.

##### 3. What is your long term and short term goal ?
My two short-term goals include, first of all, securing a job with your company, and then rapidly acquiring the necessary skills for the role, getting acquainted with my team, and becoming a productive and reliable member of the organization. One of my long-term goals is to gain leadership experience, preferably within your company. I aspire to become a team leader or manager one day, but I recognize that I will only achieve that goal through hard work, gaining experience, and making a positive impression on my employer. Another one of my long-term goals is to purchase my first house. Again, this will only happen if I achieve success at work and secure long-term employment with the same company.

##### 4. What is your most memorable day ?
The most memorable day of my life was when I mentored my co-worker and helped them pass a diffcult project seeing them achieve their goal was an incredible feeling I'll never forget


##### 5. What is your salary exception ?
- "Before providing you with a figure, I would love to learn about the salary range you are offering to candidates with the right skills and experience that you are looking for. Right now, it's more important for me to find the right job than to discuss the salary."

- "I would like to know more about my job role and responsibilities before we discuss numbers."

- "Thank you for asking. While I am flexible, I am looking for something in the range of 7-8 LPA. Given my skill set and expertise, I believe this is an appropriate range for my level of work, but I'd love to hear your thoughts."

- "I'm hoping for a salary in the range of 7-8 LPA, but I'm definitely open to negotiating based on the entire compensation package."

- 6 wala - "My salary expectation for this position is between 6.5 LPA. I feel this is a fair salary range given based on market research and my skills and experience, 
and knowledge of the industry"

- "Is there a possibility of an early performance review, perhaps after 6 months, where my salary can be reviewed?"
